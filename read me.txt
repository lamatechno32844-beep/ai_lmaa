Student Major Classification Using Random Forest
Project Description

This project aims to predict the student’s academic major (stu_group) based on academic, behavioral, and personal features using a Machine Learning classification model.

The dataset includes multiple features such as:

Academic scores (Math, English, Science, etc.)

Study time

Attendance

Parental education

Internet access

Extracurricular activities

Other student-related attributes

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

In this project, the Random Forest algorithm was used for classification.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to produce a more accurate and stable result. Instead of relying on a single decision tree, it aggregates the results of many trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

The model was trained to classify students into their respective academic majors based on the input features.

Preprocessing Steps

Categorical (text) features were converted into numerical values using Label Encoding.

The dataset was split into:

80% Training Data

20% Testing Data

The Random Forest model was trained using the training dataset.

The model performance was evaluated using the testing dataset.

Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Class balancing techniques were applied to handle potential data imbalance and improve fairness across classes.

Conclusion

The Random Forest model achieved strong performance in predicting student majors. Due to its ensemble structure, it provides better robustness and reduced overfitting compared to a single decision tree model.

Future improvements may include hyperparameter tuning and testing additional ensemble methods.
